Typingtest is a Flask based webserver project. Originating from CLI, the developers of Typingtest decided to convert it into a Flask application.
With this application, a more simple, easy to use and more "typing test" like expeirience is given. The main focus of this project is a well functioning typetest without serving any ads or tracker. A pure "vanilla" site.
This project was created with a mix of Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To run this project, just run the flaskv.py file. If running the Flask file doesn't work, be sure to follow the 'Flask' steps. A wiki will possibly be added leter on.

A big thanks to @WhineyMonkey10 for helping me with the CSS and introducing me to flask. Another thanks to @ECamelz for the insperation for the project.

Have fun typing!

## Flask  - Important for web server

This project uses Flask to run the Web Application. To properly set it up, please do the following. (Only if it doesn't work)

    $env:FLASK_APP = "flaskv.py"

If that command doesn't work use this command:
   
    set FLASK_APP=flaskv.py

Note, you can use: 

    python -c "import flask; print(flask.__version__)"
to check your flask version to make sure that it's up to date, it should be something around ``2.1.1``

If it throws any errors requesting the package to be installed, INSTALL IT

Once everything is installed simply run website.py and enjoy :)

## EXTRA INFORMATION AND CONTRIBUTING

This project is a fun project to learn and improve Flask skills. It's not meant to be a full blown huge project. We intend to keep it purley "vanilla". To contribute, simply create a branch of the project and it will be reviewed. The application itself should be pretty simple to use, and we hope you enjoy your typing :)

Keep in mind, support for this project may be dropped at any moment.
