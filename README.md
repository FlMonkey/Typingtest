Typingtest is a Flask based webserver project. Originating from CLI, the developers of Typingtest decided to convert it into a Flask application.
With this application, a more simple, easy to use and more "typing test" like expeirience is given. The main focus of this project is a well functioning typetest without serving any ads or tracker. A pure "vanilla" site.
